# ChangEdapp

## Requirements 
Android Studio - prefer machine with intel processor so you can use the emulator, otherwise you can use a physical machine
should be able to import the project directly, just use the sdk that the project comes with(will be notified about this when importing the project)

## Working implementations
Log-in works as needed, email verification as well as password verification, 
 sign-in button works as needed, 
 passwords must match in order to allow the user to create an account, 
 little indicator next to password inputs allows user to see current password so that they can match it correctly, 
 screen is done to match Zeplin file as much as possible
 
 ## Unfinished Implementations
 google sign-in button does not work,
  still need to implement google sign in, will be done as soon as possible
